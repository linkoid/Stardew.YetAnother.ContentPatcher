Changes:
  # This loads a portrait for a new character John
- Action: Load
  Target: Portraits/John
  FromFile: "assets/john.png"

  # You can list any number of load patches,
  # as long as each asset is only loaded by one patch:
- Action: Load
  Target: Portraits/Jane
  FromFile: "assets/jane.png"

  # You can also use tokens like {{TargetWithoutPath}} to edit several files at once:
- Action: Load
  Target: Characters/John, Characters/Jane
  FromFile: "assets/{{TargetWithoutPath}}.png" # assets/John.png, assets/Jane.png

  # You can use Priority to have an optional load
  # (e.g. if it'll still work when another mod loads it first):
- Action: Load
  Target: Data/Events/AdventureGuild
  FromFile: "assets/empty-event-file.json"
  Priority: Low
